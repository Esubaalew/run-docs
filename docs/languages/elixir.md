# Elixir

Functional language for scalable and maintainable applications

## Overview

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language built on the Erlang VM. It's designed for building scalable, fault-tolerant applications, particularly web services and distributed systems.

## Language Aliases

```bash
run elixir "IO.puts \"Hello\""
run ex "IO.puts \"Hello\""
run exs "IO.puts \"Hello\""
run iex "IO.puts \"Hello\""
# Output: Hello (x4)
```

## REPL Behavior

Elixir's REPL (IEx) is STATEFUL - variables and modules persist across commands.

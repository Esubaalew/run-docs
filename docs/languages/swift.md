# Swift

Powerful and intuitive language for Apple platforms

## Overview

Swift is Apple's modern programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development. It combines performance with safety and expressiveness.

## Language Aliases

```bash
run swift "print(\"Hello\")"
run swiftlang "print(\"Hello\")"
# Output: Hello (x2)
```

!!! tip "Multi-line Code: Use Heredoc"
    For multi-line code, **use heredoc** (`<< 'EOF'`) to avoid shell quoting and escaping issues.

## REPL Behavior

Swift's REPL maintains state across commands. Variables, functions, and types persist within the same REPL session.

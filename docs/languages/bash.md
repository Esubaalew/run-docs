# Bash

Unix shell and command language for automation

## Overview

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the default shell on most Unix-like systems. It's used for scripting, automation, and system administration tasks.

## Language Aliases

```bash
run bash "echo 'Hello'"
run sh "echo 'Hello'"
run shell "echo 'Hello'"
run zsh "echo 'Hello'"
# Output: Hello (x4)
```

## REPL Behavior

Bash's REPL is STATEFUL - variables and functions persist across commands.

# Crystal

Fast as C, slick as Ruby

## Overview

Crystal is a compiled language with Ruby-like syntax and static type checking. It aims to combine the elegance of Ruby with the performance of C.

## Language Aliases

```bash
run crystal "puts \"Hello\""
run cr "puts \"Hello\""
run crystal-lang "puts \"Hello\""
# Output: Hello (x3)
```

## REPL Behavior

Crystal's REPL maintains state across commands. Variables, methods, and classes persist within the same REPL session.
